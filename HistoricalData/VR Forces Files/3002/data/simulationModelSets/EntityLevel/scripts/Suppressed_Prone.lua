-- This script changes entity movement behavior when it is suppressed.
-- If the entity becomes suppressed to level 2 or 3, the entity stops and falls prone.
-- The reaction is not ended until the suppression level goes back to 0.

-- Some basic VRF Utilities defined in a common module.
require "vrfutil"

-- Global Variables. Global variables get saved when a scenario gets checkpointed.
-- They get re-initialized when a checkpointed scenario is loaded.

-- Posture the entity was in when it became supressed.

-- Called when this task is being suspended, likely by a reaction activating.
function suspend()

end

-- Called when this task is being resumed after being suspended.
function resume()
   -- Don't call init. We don't really know what posture to recover to when the
   -- suppression level goes back to 0, but if we are "popping" tasks off the stack
   -- then we assume that whatever the entity was doing when oldPosture was 
   -- originally set will be resumed, and we'll want the original oldPosture.
   
   -- The suppression level could have gone to 0 and then back to 1 while this
   -- reaction was suspended, but don't try to second guess that and issue another
   -- set-posture Set.
