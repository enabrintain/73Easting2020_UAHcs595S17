-- This script template has each of the script entry point functions.
-- They are described in detail in VR-Forces Configuration Guide.

-- Some basic VRF Utilities defined in a common module.
require "vrfutil"

-- Global Variables. Global variables get saved when a scenario gets checkpointed.
-- They get re-initialized when a checkpointed scenario is loaded.

-- Task Parameters Available in Script
--  taskParameters.startPt Type: Location3D - The first point of the chord along which to test intersections
--  taskParameters.endPt Type: Location3D - The second point of the chord along which to test intersections


-- Called when the task first starts. Never called again.
function init()
   vrf:chordIntersectionDebug(taskParameters.startPt,
      taskParameters.endPt)
   vrf:endTask(true)
end

-- Called each tick while this task is active.
function tick()
end

-- Called when this task is being suspended, likely by a reaction activating.
function suspend()
   -- By default, halt all subtasks and other entity tasks started by this task when suspending.
   vrf:stopAllSubtasks()
   vrf:stopAllTasks()
end

-- Called when this task is being resumed after being suspended.
function resume()
   -- By default, simply call init() to start the task over.
   init()
end
-- Called immediately before a scenario checkpoint is saved when
-- this task is active.
-- It is typically not necessary to add code to this function.
function saveState()
end

-- Called immediately after a scenario checkpoint is loaded in which
-- this task is active.
-- It is typically not necessary to add code to this function.
function loadState()
end

-- Called when this task is ending, for any reason.
-- It is typically not necessary to add code to this function.
function shutdown()
end

-- Called whenever the entity receives a text report message while
-- this task is active.
--   message is the message text string.
--   sender is the SimObject which sent the message.
function receiveTextMessage(message, sender)
end
