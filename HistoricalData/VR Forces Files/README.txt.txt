This archive contains two folders, 3001 and 3002, each corresponding to a VR Forces installation. Each contains scenario files,
terrain files, model sets, and temporary files. The data and userData folders should be copied to the installation folder of
VR Forces for a particular machine. One machine should be using the data from 3001 and another should be using data from 3002.
The Temp folder should be copied to the C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local directory of the corresponding machine.
