This directory contains examples from the VR-Vantage, upon which VR-Forces is based. 
These can be identified by their name as they start with "example".
For instructions on use, please consult the "How To Build"
section of the examples classdoc (doc/classdoc/examples/howtobuild.html)

Additionally, the plugins folder and the bin folder are not examples, but they do 
contain the .lib and .exe files for the VR-Vantage examples.

ToDo: Phill needs to ask for a VRLink license
